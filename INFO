Created AWS s3 bucket with name: sportbar-dataengg-fmcg-project
Then upload the childs data
Then come back to databricks and add external data from AWS S3

and then create stack from Databricks to AWS
Stack name I created is -> databricks-s3-ingest-dc2c0-sportbar-fmcg
so remember the S3 connection with databricks is a direct connection and everything deleted from here will also be deleted from there
and then move the s3 data to bronze layer
