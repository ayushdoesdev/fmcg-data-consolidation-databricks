# FMCG Retail Data Consolidation ETL Pipeline

*A real-world data engineering project using Lakehouse + Medallion Architecture*

## Project Overview

In the FMCG domain, large retail organizations often grow through acquisitions. When a big retail company acquires a smaller one, their data ecosystems usually differ in structure, format, and technology.
This project simulates a real-life industry scenario where we consolidate data from **two retail companies** into a unified **Lakehouse Architecture** using a scalable ETL pipeline.

The pipeline extracts, transforms, and loads data into **Bronze → Silver → Gold** layers following the **Medallion Architecture**, enabling unified analytics and BI reporting.

## Architecture Overview

### **Tech Stack**

* **Python** – Data processing, orchestration scripts
* **SQL** – Transformations and Gold layer modeling
* **Amazon S3** – Lakehouse storage (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
* **Spark (PySpark)** – Distributed ETL computation
* **Medallion Architecture** – Bronze → Silver → Gold
* **BI Dashboard** – Insights generation (e.g., Tableau/Power BI)
* **Genie** – Query acceleration / Lakehouse query engine

## Lakehouse Data Flow (Medallion)

### **1. Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion**

* Load raw data from both companies into S3 (CSV).
* No transformations, only ingestion and basic quality checks.
* Stores **raw sales, inventory, and product master data**.

### **2. Silver Layer – Standardization & Cleansing**

* Apply schema normalization for both companies.
* Deduplicate, validate, and harmonize columns.
* Conform dimensions (dates, products, stores).
* Output is **clean, query-ready structured data**.

### **3. Gold Layer – Business Models & KPIs**

* Build aggregated fact tables:

  * Sales fact
  * Inventory fact
  * Customer analytics
* Create unified models used by BI dashboards.
* Power BI/Tableau dashboard built on top of this layer.
